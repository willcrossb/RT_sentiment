# RT_sentiment
High level overview:
The "collect" file implements a loop to scrape the tweets and saves them as pickle
The "analysis" file contains all of the code needed to generate results
It takes a database of tweets and ultimately converts said database into a sentiment index. Documentation within the code will hopefully be clear
