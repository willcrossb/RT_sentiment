      "1617286681240936448 2023-01-22 22:22:47 +0000 <bigd_o_cycler> I promise you, if the middle class white women that I serve every day would just tip me I’d be doin a lot better financially… instead, none of them tip… like NONE. Most women don’t ever tip but when they do the only ones that will are black and Latina women. But they don’t\n",
      "1617282378703011840 2023-01-22 22:05:41 +0000 <pr0blemscl0wn> Funny that the first and only other time I played it in 2020 I just sort of followed the caravan and did much better financially but got so little story that I called it a day\n",
      "1617268642382503936 2023-01-22 21:11:06 +0000 <CryptoSan7> @NHelen84 @alanaevansxxx @MarcosWood18 @LayahHeilpern I should have been more nuanced, but the facts remain that more men are porn addicts (although many women are, too) and women might be compensated better financially, it's tragic to see them deteriorate into mere shadows of themselves, due to trauma accelerated by the industry.\n",
      "1617259047719256070 2023-01-22 20:32:58 +0000 <RobotAffinity> @MontyGatorSFM18 Same situation here, only I just graduated from university in July last year. I could move out, but it works out better financially for me and my parents if we stick together. Mortgages are stupid right now, and rent is even worse. We are better off together right now :)\n",
      "1617249037442326529 2023-01-22 19:53:12 +0000 <DSJ099> @POTUS Doubt it. I was most assuredly doing better financially before you took office. But please, keep acting like you're helping anyone.\n",
      "1617242106099306496 2023-01-22 19:25:39 +0000 <_amanitavir0sa> whenever we went out to eat, my parents told others who realized and voiced i ate in astonishing amounts \"u see, u do better financially buying her a dress than inviting her to lunch.\"\n",
      "1617221253227581441 2023-01-22 18:02:47 +0000 <reyskee_> If niggas hated integration as much as they hated the eagles we’d be so much better financially\n"
